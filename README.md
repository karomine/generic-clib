# generic-clib
Library of generic c data structures 

This library is for demonstration/educational purposes
- taking a lower level look at data structures
- examining c generics with void pointers and function pointers
- comparing various implementations
- examine abstraction of ADT through API 

Disclaimer
- it is not rigorously tested
- it ignores functionality essential to production development such as checking for NULL returns from malloc/realloc
